# Project_wlosing

As part of diving into Python, I have been creating  "Project_w≈Çosing", a platform dedicated to hair care enthusiasts. This project main purpose is to boost my Python programming skills while practising and getting used to object-oriented programming, abstraction, and decomposition. It has also been an opportunity to experiment with some algorithms, think out the scalability issue and considering the Big O notation at the same time. The project is built using the Django framework and consisted of:
- Functions.
- Models representing hair types (categorized by colour, length, porosity, and curl level) and cosmetic products. Most models include specific methods.
- Functions collaborating with HTML templates and styles from Bootstrap components to render the application on the server.
- Unit testing procedures for models, methods, and functions.

### Project functionality:

Users can create accounts with specific email and password requirements.
After creating an account, the app collects data related to the user's hair type, which are stored in the database. Users had the flexibility to modify or supplement this information, such as updating their haircut details.
The user profile displays their hair type and the cosmetics in their "dopp kit," allowing them to add new products to it.
In the "Cosmetic's base" section, all cosmetics are categorized by type. The logged-in users have access to adding existing cosmetics to their dopp kit or contribute new products to the base.
Version control was achieved by tracking of files, and commiting subsequent code versions  to Git storage.

This project provided me with an experience in Python, Django, and various programming concepts, practise of object-oriented principles, abstraction, and algorithmic considerations, as well as progress in unit testing. It also illustrates practical skills in database management, front-end development using HTML and Bootstrap, and version control with Git.
